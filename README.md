# Graphical-Python-Project-2
Convert the date currently shown in the calendarWidget to a Julian date.
Convert the resulting integer Julian date to a string formatting it with commas as shown in the sample run below.
In addition to converting the calendar widget date when pushButtonConvert is clicked, make the program more interactive by having the date converted to Julian and show it in the labelJulianDate any time a date is picked on the calendar.
Also, make the Julian Date shown immediately when the program starts as well as having it change as dates are picked on the calendar.
